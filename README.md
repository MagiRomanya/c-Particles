# c-Particles

This project aims to solve the newton equations numerically for an N body system using c.

## Quick Start
```
build.sh
./particles
```

## To develop
- [x] Get RK4 working 
- [x] Harmonic oscillator
- [x] Gravitational atraction for N bodies D dimensions
- [ ] Implement a 2D UI to display the results
